<div class="subtitle"><b>Background</b></div>
<div class="content">
The program 'vccm' computes connectivity concordance maps (CCM).
The main idea is to assign a label to each voxel based on the intersubject reproducibility of
its whole-brain pattern of connectivity. Specifically, we compute the correlations of time-courses
of each voxel with every other voxel for each subject. Voxels whose correlation pattern is
consistent across data sets receive high values. 
Concordance across data sets is measured using either Kendall's W or the overall concordance measure
OCCC.<p>

<div class="subtitle"><b>Preparing input data</b></div>
<div class="content">
Preprocessed functional data serve as input to 'vccm'.
The preprocessing should normally include motion correction,
slicetime correction, spatial smoothing
and registration to some template (e.g. MNI or Talairach) resampled
to 3x3x3 mm^3 resolution. Higher resolutions (e.g. 2x2x2 mm^3) are 
generally not computable on standard hardware. 
It is important that baseline drifts are removed. 
See <a href="../START/index_prep.html"><u>standard preprocessing</u></a> chapter for more information on preprocessing.
<br><br>
It is essential that the mask is geometrically compatible with the
functional data and covers the desired portions of the brain. In particular,
the mask must have the same spatial resolution, the same image matrix size and
orientation as the functional data.
To check if the mask is correct, the following calls should be used:
<br><br>

> <tt> vtimestep -in functional.v -out tmp.v </tt> <br>
> <tt> vconvert -in mask.v -out zmask.v -repn float</tt> <br>
> <tt> vlv -in tmp.v -z zmask.v </tt><br><br>

The first call 'vtimestep' extracts the first time step (volume) from the
functional data. The second call converts the mask so that it can be 
visualized in the third call 'vlv'. If the mask aligns well with the
functional data and covers the desired parts of the brain then all is well
and the files 'tmp.v' and 'zmask.v' may be deleted. 
Otherwise, the mask must be redefined.

<div class="subtitle"><b>Calling 'vccm'</b></div>
<div class="content">
Once the functional data are preprocessed and a mask is defined, the analysis can begin.
Computation times depend on computer hardware, size of the mask and length of the time series.
A full-brain coverage mask at 3x3x3 mm^3 and 200 time steps acquired in 15  subjects 
on a 3GHz cpu may take several hours of computation time. 
Here is an example call using the standard mask. It will process all data sets called
'functional_*.v' in the current directory. (Note: the asterisk * is a wildcard and works as
a placeholder).<br><br>
